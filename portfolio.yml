# Whether to open a graphical window with Serena's logs (not supported on MacOS).
# This is useful both for troubleshooting and for monitoring the tool calls,
# especially when using the agno playground, since the tool calls are not always shown,
# and the input params are never shown in the agno UI.
# When used as MCP server for Claude Desktop, the logs are primarily for troubleshooting.
# Note: unfortunately, the various entities starting the Serena server or agent do so in
# mysterious ways, often starting multiple instances of the process without shutting down
# previous instances. This leads to multiple log windows being opened, and only the last
# window being updated. Since we can't control how agno or Claude Desktop starts Serena, we have to live with this limitation for now.
